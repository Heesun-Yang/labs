Hello from Docker.
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
 
To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker Engine CLI client contacted the Docker Engine daemon.
 2. The Docker Engine daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
 3. The Docker Engine daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker Engine daemon streamed that output to the Docker Engine CLI client, which sent it
    to your terminal.
 
To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
